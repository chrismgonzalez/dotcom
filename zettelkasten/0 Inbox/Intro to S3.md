### What is Object Storage (Object-based Storage)?

Object storage is a data storage architecture that **manages data as objects**, **as opposed** to other storage architectures.

- S3 provides you with _**unlimited storage_*. (Except for outposts)
- You don’t need to think about the underlying infrastructure
- The S3 Console provides an interface for you to upload and access your data

### S3 Object

Objects contain your data. They are like files. Object may consist of:

- **Key** this is the name of the object
- **Value** the data itself made up of a sequence of bytes
- **Version ID** when versioning enabled, the version of object
- **Metadata** additional information attached to the object

### S3 Bucket

Buckets hold objects. Buckets can also have folders which in turn hold objects

S3 is a universal namespace, so bucket names must be unique (think like having a domain name)

You can store an individual object from 0 Bytes to 5 Terabytes in size
